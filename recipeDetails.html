                Great recipe! I made it exactly as described for the first time and it was absolutely wonderful and a great combination with Halibut. it is also good with a meat added and then served over a bed of spinach as a salad. Lots of options!! great flavors.Just delightful! I had top notch in season peaches to use and this just turned out so beautiful. Love this crust and can easily be made in advance as someone else said and just refrigerated until ready. Comes together so easily. Beautifully balanced sweetness. Can't wait to try with other fruits!
